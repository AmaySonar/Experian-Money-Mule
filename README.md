# Experian - "Fast Cash, Hidden Crimes : are you being used as a Money Mule ?"


# Project Description 

This project was developed as a part of data science challenge with Experian, a global leader in data and analytics, serving over **1 billion individuals** and **25 million business** across more than ** 40 countries**. Whith around **22,000 employees**, Experian uses data to empower individuals and business supporting responsible lending, fraud prevention, identity verification and personalised marketing. 

In recent years, **money mule fraud** has become a rapidly growing threat in the financial sector. According to **Santander UK**, there were ****22,467 money mule cases** reported between October 2023 and September 2024 a **32% increase** from the previous year. Particularly alarming is the **26% rise** in cases involving **young adults aged 18 to 24**. Many are misled into believing that ‚Äúlending a bank account‚Äù for a quick cash reward is harmless. In reality, these transactions often facilitate **serious criminal activity**, including **child trafficking** and **drug distribution**.

This project focuses on identifying suspicious accounts likely to be involved in money mule operations using a structured data analytics approach. Given anonymized datasets by a high-profile bank, our goal was to  
‚Ä¢	Audit and clean the data  
‚Ä¢	Engineer meaningful features  
‚Ä¢	Conduct exploratory data analysis    
‚Ä¢	Build predictive models to classify potential mule accounts   
‚Ä¢	Visualize key patterns and insights    

The work supports Experian‚Äôs mission to detect and prevent financial fraud, protect vulnerable individuals, and ensure a safer financial ecosystem.
